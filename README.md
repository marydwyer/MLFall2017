# MLFall2017

This repository contains projects from ECE-414-1: Machine Learning course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. The class was taught by Professor Sam Keene during the Fall of 2017.

# Course Description 
Machine learning of structural relationships among variables from empirical data. This course covers decision theory and Bayesian Machine Learning. Projects were conducted on: <br />
Classification: linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines(SVM), boosting. <br />
Regression: leastsquares,regularization methods,logistic regression. <br />
Clustering: kmeans and EM algorithms. <br />
Modelselection: bias-variance tradeoff, crossvalidation, over-fitting. <br />
Feature selection and dimensionality reductionmethods including PCA, ICA, MDS, Kernel methods.
